-- VAW — Add To Wallet | Metric: wallet_provisioning | Window: 30 days
-- Source tables: DG6V01.TACTIC_EVNT_IP_AR_HIST, DDWV05.CLNT_CRD_POS_LOG, DL_DECMAN.TOKEN_LIST
-- Success: zero-dollar provisioning txn (AMT1=0), VVD BIN (45190/45199), token confirmed
-- Note: add TXN_DT date filter to avoid full EDW scan (known performance gotcha)
-- Output: vintage curve (mnc, cohort, test, vintage, leads, success)
-- Note: day_sequence ensures a complete 0-30 day grid; days with no successes carry forward via cumulative SUM.
